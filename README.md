This R package is used to calculate the conventional **Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)** and the **Self-Calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI)**, the widely used drought indicators around the world, at <u>**monthly and weekly**</u> scale. Precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PE) data are required to calculate the PDSI and scPDSI.

This package is build up on the C++ codes of the scPDSI provided by Nathan Wells, Steve Goddard and Michael J. Hayes in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

## Installation

Get it from the CRAN repository:

```R
install.packages('scPDSI')
```

Or install from GitHub (usually the development version):

```R
devtools::install_github('kongdd/scPDSI')
```

## Example

This is an example showing how to calculate the scPDSI:

``` r
## P and PE are the vectors of monthly precipitation and PE data.
sc_pdsi <- pdsi(P, PE, start = 1960, sc = TRUE)

plot(sc_pdsi)                 # Plot the calculated PDSI (X) values
plot(sc_pdsi, index = "PHDI") # plot Palmer hydrological drought index
plot(sc_pdsi, index = "WPLM") # plot weighted PDSI
```
